The first click on the Show Add button in the CategoryTable
does not show the add section!?

CategoryTable component has categories
  @published Categories categories;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template>
    <category-table categories="{{categories}}"></category-table>
  </template>

CategoryAdd component has categories
  @published Categories categories;
that are passed to it when the component is used:
  <template if="{{showAdd}}">
	<category-add
	  categories="{{categories}}">
	</category-add>
  </template>

Are the two categories the same object?
Probably not.

If a category is added to the second categories,
how to refresh the first categories?
